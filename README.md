# RESTful CRUD App with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

It is a complete project teaching the basics of REST and using them to build an easy, fast, single-page web app.

If you want to run this sample code, you will need to create data directory in your repository, as my data directory has been removed from the repository.

In your data directory, you need to include your MongoDB database information.
